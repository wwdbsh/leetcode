## Two Sum

* array, hash map
* Time complexity : O(n). We traverse the list containing nn elements only once. Each look up in the table costs only O(1) time.
* Space complexity : O(n). The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores exactly nn elements.
