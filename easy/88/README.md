## Merge Sorted Array

* array, sort
* Time complexity : O((n+m)log(n+m)).
   * The cost of sorting a list of length x using a built-in sorting algorithm is O(xlogx). Because in this case we're sorting a list of length m+n, we get a total time complexity of O((n+m)log(n+m)).
* Space complexity : O(n), but it can vary.
   * Most programming languages have a built-in sorting algorithm that uses O(n) space.
